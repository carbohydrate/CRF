# CRF

Change color of default raid frames if raid member has atonement on them.
Not released.

## Notes
Known bug if players join/leave while in combat.  Frames enter a weird state and can't target certain frames or targeting one player will target someone else.  To fix this state, on the left-hand side of UI, select the little pop out arrow and in the groups 1-8 area turn them all off and back on.  Or /reload.
TODO feature: Add different color if atonement is less then x seconds.

## Slash Commands
- /crf on/off
- /crf show/hide (turn frames on/off while not in a raid/group. For testing.)
